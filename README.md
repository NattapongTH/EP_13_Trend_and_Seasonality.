## Description

The dataset contains SKU values over a period of time. The primary objective of this analysis is to visually represent and understand the underlying trends, seasonality, and other patterns within the data.

## Visualizations

1. **Line Plot**: Represents the time series progression of SKU values. 
2. **Box Plot**: Offers insights into SKU value distributions across different years.
3. **Heatmap**: Provides a color-coded visual summary of SKU values across months and years, making patterns and anomalies easily discernible.
4. **Seasonal Plot**: A tool to observe and compare recurring trends across different periods, showcasing the underlying seasonality in the dataset.
5. **Seasonal Decomposition Plot**: Decomposes the time series into its fundamental components - trend, seasonal, and residual - to give a clearer understanding of the patterns, trends, and deviations in the data.

## Usage
