# EP_13_Trend_and_Seasonality_Analysis


This repository contains an explorative analysis of a time series dataset, focusing on trend and seasonality patterns. Various visualization techniques, including line plots, box plots, heatmaps, seasonal plots, and seasonal decomposition plots, are used to dissect and understand the data.

## Description

The dataset contains SKU values over a period of time. The primary objective of this analysis is to visually represent and understand the underlying trends, seasonality, and other patterns within the data.

## Usage

To dive into the Python code and understand the methodologies and libraries used in this analysis, refer to [EP_13_Trend_and_Seasonality](https://github.com/NattapongTH/EP_13_Trend_and_Seasonality./blob/main/EP13_GitHub.ipynb).

## Visualizations

1. **Line Plot**: Represents the time series progression of SKU values. 
2. **Box Plot**: Offers insights into SKU value distributions across different years.
3. **Heatmap**: Provides a color-coded visual summary of SKU values across months and years, making patterns and anomalies easily discernible.
4. **Seasonal Plot**: A tool to observe and compare recurring trends across different periods, showcasing the underlying seasonality in the dataset.
5. **Seasonal Decomposition Plot**: Decomposes the time series into its fundamental components - trend, seasonal, and residual - to give a clearer understanding of the patterns, trends, and deviations in the data.
